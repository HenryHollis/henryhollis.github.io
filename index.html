<p>
    I am a Computational Biologist bridging the gap between <strong>Computer Science</strong> and complex <strong>biological data</strong>.
    With a <strong>background in CS</strong> and a <strong>Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering</strong>, I specialize in building scalable pipelines
    for single-cell transcriptomics and high-dimensional genomic data. During my doctoral research, I became proficient at translating the messiness
    of life science data into actionable biological insights, with a track record of publication in Neuron and Frontiers.

Currently working on the <strong>ORPHEUS</strong> algorithm to quantify circadian rhythm phase dispersion in snRNA-seq data.
